# ProteinNaming
Files and code for the project of naming plasmid backbone proteins.

As of 7/15/2016 (when the last major changes to this project were made), there are still many potential glitches and inefficiencies in the code. Please don't hesitate to send me an email with questions at zaclindsey1996@pointloma.edu.

If you are wondering where to start, take a look at the pdf documentation (which is, unfortunately, incomplete).
